# Gender-Classification-

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of classifying gender based on a set of features such as physical attributes, voice characteristics, handwriting patterns, or even facial features. 
The goal is to train and evaluate a model that can accurately distinguish between male and female classes using a labeled dataset.
